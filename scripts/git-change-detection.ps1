.SYNOPSIS
    Alternative approach: Use git diff to detect meaningful changes without building.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script uses git to detect if any meaningful source code files have changed
    since the last tag, avoiding the need to build and compare outputs.

.PARAMETER ProjectPath
    Path to the .csproj file (optional, for validation)

.PARAMETER TagName
    Specific tag to compare against (optional, defaults to latest tag)

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\git-change-detection.ps1
#>

param(
    [string]$ProjectPath = "source/Electrified.TimeSeries/Electrified.TimeSeries.csproj",
    [string]$TagName = ""
